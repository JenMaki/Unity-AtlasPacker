# AtlasPacker

This Unity `EditorWindow` allows you to select a folder that contains multiple textures and convert them into a singular sprite sheet. It packs the textures together and uses the original texture name when slicing the new sprite sheet.

## Usage

- Add the Editor folder, containing [AtlasPacker.cs](Editor/AtlasPacker.cs), to your project.
- Open the Window in Unity from `Window/Textures/AtlasPacker`.
- Select a folder in your project, containing the input textures.
- Adjust settings or keep defaults, and click build!
